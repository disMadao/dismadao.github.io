# Papers Directory

This directory contains PDF files of publications.

## File Naming Convention

Use lowercase with hyphens, format: `title-venue-year.pdf`

Examples:
- `astral-sigcomm2025.pdf`
- `etran-nsdi2025.pdf`
- `bcc-infocom2024.pdf`

## How to Add Papers

1. Place your PDF file in this directory
2. Update `_data/publications.yml` with the pdf path:
   ```yaml
   - title: "Your Paper Title"
     pdf: /assets/papers/your-paper-venue2025.pdf
   ```

The paper title will automatically become clickable in the Publications page.
