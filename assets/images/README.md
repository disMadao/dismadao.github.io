# Images Directory

## Structure

- `profile.jpg` - Advisor's profile photo (180x180px recommended)
- `students/` - Student and alumni photos (140x140px recommended, will be displayed as circles)
  - `student-a.jpg`
  - `student-b.jpg`
  - `alumni-c.jpg`

## Usage

Replace the placeholder images with actual photos. The system will automatically display:
- Profile photo in the About page (square with rounded corners)
- Student photos in the Students page (circular display)

If a photo is missing, the system will show a placeholder with the person's initial.
